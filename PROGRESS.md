# Progress

A living checklist tracking `signalman` against [`spec.md`](spec.md). Status
legend: ☐ not started, ◐ in progress, ☑ done.

## Implementation

Milestones are derived from the spec's milestone table. Each is broken into the
concrete slices needed to call it done.

### M0 — Scaffold ◐

- ☑ NestJS + TypeScript monorepo tooling (`nest-cli.json`, `tsconfig`, strict mode)
- ☑ Jest test runner wired to the monorepo path aliases
- ☑ ESLint (flat config) + Prettier
- ☑ CI workflow: install → lint → typecheck → build → test
- ☑ `libs/propagation` — W3C trace-context inject/extract for broker headers
- ☑ `services/gateway` — the public **HTTP entry point**, the start of a booking
  and of its trace. Beyond the health probe it now serves the booking surface:
  `POST /bookings` validates the request, mints a booking id when absent, and
  drives the saga by calling `Coordinator.Book` over gRPC, recording the outcome;
  `GET /bookings/:id` is the thin status endpoint that reads the recorded outcome
  back (carrying the booking's `traceId` so an operator can jump to its trace).
  Telemetry starts at boot and `ObservabilityModule` wraps every request, so the
  `POST /bookings` SERVER span is the **root** of the booking trace; the
  coordinator client opens a CLIENT child span and injects the W3C `traceparent`
  into the gRPC metadata, so the coordinator continues from the gateway (the
  gateway → coordinator hop of M3). Hexagonal like the coordinator: the booking
  service depends on a `CoordinatorPort` and a `BookingStore`, unit-tested against
  fakes and an in-memory store (Postgres-backed later behind the same token), with
  the live HTTP surface verified end to end via supertest and a booted process
- ☑ All eight services scaffolded:
  - ☑ `inventory` — gRPC `Hold`/`Release` over NestJS microservices, holds +
    per-SKU availability domain, outbox-staged `inventory.held`/`.released`
    events, observability interceptor on every gRPC handler; boots as a
    standalone gRPC microservice and verified end to end with a real client
  - ☑ `payments` — gRPC `Authorize`/`Capture`/`Void` over NestJS microservices,
    payment source of truth wrapping a **simulated PSP** (controllable latency +
    decline/failure injection, each call a CLIENT span — the external boundary
    hop), outbox-staged `payment.authorized`/`.captured`/`.voided` events,
    observability interceptor on every gRPC handler; boots as a standalone gRPC
    microservice and verified end to end with a real client
  - ☑ `supplier` — gRPC `Confirm`/`Cancel` over NestJS microservices, the
    partner source of truth wrapping a **simulated external partner**
    (deliberately slow + flaky: controllable latency + reject/failure injection,
    each call a CLIENT span — the partner boundary hop), outbox-staged
    `supplier.confirmed`/`.cancelled` events, observability interceptor on every
    gRPC handler; boots as a standalone gRPC microservice and verified end to end
    with a real client
  - ☑ `ledger` — gRPC `Commit`/`Reverse` over NestJS microservices, the
    **internal** financial-record source of truth (no external boundary: a commit
    is a posting that always succeeds for a positive amount, a non-positive amount
    is rejected as data), outbox-staged `ledger.committed`/`.reversed` events,
    observability interceptor on every gRPC handler; decodes the `uint64 amount`
    as a JS number at the boundary (`loader: { longs: Number }`) so posted amounts
    and event payloads are plain numbers; boots as a standalone gRPC microservice
    and verified end to end with a real client
  - ☑ `coordinator` — the saga orchestrator. Serves `Coordinator.Book` over
    NestJS gRPC microservices; a single `Book` drives `inventory.hold →
    payments.authorize → supplier.confirm → payments.capture → ledger.commit`
    through four gRPC leg-client ports and unwinds the completed steps in reverse
    on any failure (rejection or outage). Every step and compensation is its own
    span under the `Book` SERVER span; the orchestrator depends only on the leg
    ports so it is unit-tested against in-memory fakes, and the whole booking is
    verified end to end against all four live leg services over gRPC
  - ☑ `notifier` — the async tail of the saga. Boots as a standalone Nest
    application context (a pure event consumer, no synchronous gRPC/HTTP surface);
    a `BookingNotificationConsumer` wraps `@signalman/inbox`'s `IdempotentConsumer`
    (dedup namespace `notifier`) to consume `ledger.committed` on the booking's
    own trace and tell the customer via a **simulated notification provider**
    (`SimulatedNotificationChannel`: controllable latency + failure injection, each
    send a CLIENT span — the provider boundary hop). Idempotent at two layers —
    the inbox skips a redelivered message id, and `NotifierService` notifies each
    booking at most once — so neither redelivery double-sends; a provider outage
    rethrows for NACK without recording. Terminal consumer, so it keeps a
    notification source-of-truth record but stages no outbox event. **Now wired to
    the broker**: the module registers a `BrokerSubscriptionHost`
    (§`@signalman/broker`) that subscribes the consumer to `ledger.committed` off
    the configured broker on application bootstrap, so the terminal event drives the
    notification in a running service. Unit-tested end to end (process-once,
    redelivery, two-layer dedup, trace continuation with the provider hop nested
    under the consume span, NACK-on-outage), plus a module-level wiring test driving
    a real `ledger.committed` event through the registered host onto a shared broker
    (notified once across a redelivery), and verified to boot subscribed
  - ☑ `reconciler` — the periodic comparison of the sources of truth. Boots as a
    standalone Nest application context (a background job, no synchronous gRPC/HTTP
    surface); a `ReconciliationScheduler` runs `ReconcilerService.runOnce` on an
    interval (`RECONCILER_INTERVAL_MS`, surviving a failed pass so the backstop
    keeps running). Each pass pulls settled bookings from a `SourceOfTruthGateway`,
    compares each across inventory/supplier/ledger with the pure
    `detectDivergences` engine (three invariants: `supplier_confirmed_ledger_missing`
    — the headline — `ledger_committed_supplier_unconfirmed`, and `orphaned_hold`),
    and records each new disagreement as a `DivergenceFinding`, idempotent per
    `(bookingId, kind)`. Every pass runs under a `reconcile.pass` span and every
    new finding opens a `reconcile.divergence` span carrying a **span link** back
    to the originating booking trace (and stamps the finding's `traceId`) — the
    "finding linked to the trace" payoff. Unit-tested end to end against the
    in-memory gateway/findings reference stores (detection across all invariants,
    cross-pass idempotency, trace-linked spans, pass-error handling) and verified
    to boot; the broker/Postgres-backed gateway and findings store land with the
    datastore/broker milestones behind the same DI tokens
- ☑ `libs/otel` — OpenTelemetry SDK bootstrap: OTLP/HTTP exporters, resource identity, managed start/flush lifecycle
- ☑ `libs/logging` — trace-correlated structured JSON logger (NestJS `LoggerService`, lifts `trace_id`/`span_id`/`trace_flags` from the active span)
- ☑ `libs/interceptor` — NestJS observability interceptor: per-handler SERVER span (active for the call so child spans join the trace) + RED metrics (duration histogram + error counter), HTTP/gRPC mapped to OTel semconv, wired via `ObservabilityModule.forRoot`
- ☑ Remaining libs scaffolded: `outbox` ☑, `inbox` ☑, `broker` ☑
  - ☑ `libs/outbox` — transactional outbox: durable record + trace capture (`createOutboxRecord`), `OutboxStore` contract, `InMemoryOutboxStore` reference (leasing, back-off, dead-letter), and a `OutboxRelay` that publishes each row under a PRODUCER span parented to the staged trace (at-least-once, capped exponential back-off, dead-lettering)
  - ☑ `libs/inbox` — idempotent consumer: `InboxStore.processOnce` dedup contract (marker committed atomically with the handler's side effects), `InMemoryInboxStore` reference (synchronous claim, rollback-on-failure), and an `IdempotentConsumer` that opens a CONSUMER span continuing the message's trace, skips redeliveries (tagged on the span), and rethrows handler errors for NACK — the dedup core that pairs with the outbox for effectively-once
  - ☑ `libs/broker` — the broker boundary that closes the async-event hop: a
    transport-agnostic `MessageBroker` (publish + subject-pattern subscribe, NATS
    wildcards via `subjectMatches`), an `InMemoryBroker` reference (fan-out,
    queue-group load-balancing, at-least-once redelivery on NACK with
    dead-lettering, async delivery awaitable via `drain`), the `BrokerPublisher`
    adapter implementing the outbox relay's `Publisher` over the broker
    (`toBrokerMessage`), and the `toConsumedMessage` bridge onto the inbox
    `IdempotentConsumer`. A cross-library integration test wires
    outbox → relay → broker → inbox and asserts the three hops form one connected
    trace; the NATS-backed adapter swaps in behind the same boundary with the
    docker stack
- ◐ Broker **transport** — the **NATS JetStream adapter** (`NatsBroker`) is built
  behind `libs/broker`'s `MessageBroker` boundary, the production sibling of the
  in-memory reference. It maps the reference semantics onto JetStream: a durable
  stream, native subject-wildcard matching, fan-out via an ephemeral push
  consumer per subscriber, queue-group load-balancing via a shared durable
  consumer, and at-least-once delivery with `nak()` redelivery up to `maxDeliver`
  then `term()` + dead-letter. A header codec round-trips the trace-carrying
  `BrokerHeaders` (and the message id) across the wire. Verified end to end
  against a **live JetStream server** by a gated integration test
  (`nats-broker.integration.spec.ts`, run with `NATS_TEST_URL` set; skipped by
  default so CI stays green) — fan-out, queue groups, redelivery, dead-letter,
  **and the headline async trace continuity** (saga step → JetStream publish →
  consume on one connected trace)
- ◐ Per-service relay/subscription wiring (choosing the broker via env) — **both
  sides are now wired**. `@signalman/broker` adds `createBrokerFromEnv` (env-driven
  transport selection: in-memory reference by default, `NatsBroker` when
  `BROKER=nats`, returning the broker, its `kind`, and a `close`) and two
  framework-agnostic lifecycle hosts whose `onApplicationBootstrap`/
  `onApplicationShutdown` match NestJS's hooks structurally: `OutboxRelayHost` on
  the producing side (start polling on boot; stop, flush once, and close on
  shutdown) and `BrokerSubscriptionHost` on the consuming side (subscribe on boot;
  drop the subscriptions and close the transport on shutdown). All four producing
  legs (`inventory`, `payments`, `supplier`, `ledger`) register the relay host
  behind a `MESSAGE_BROKER` token, and the **notifier now registers the
  subscription host** — subscribing its `IdempotentConsumer` to `ledger.committed`
  off the configured broker — so a booking's terminal event drives the
  notification in a running service, not just in unit tests. Each side enables
  shutdown hooks and runs on the booking trace. Tested at the lib level (env
  selection, both host lifecycles) and with module-level tests driving a real
  `inventory.held` event through the relay host and a real `ledger.committed` event
  through the subscription host onto shared brokers. The reconciler's consuming
  side — a broker-backed `SourceOfTruthGateway` projecting
  `inventory.*`/`supplier.*`/`ledger.*` — lands next
- ☑ OTel Collector — OTLP/HTTP+gRPC receiver, batch processor, OTLP→Tempo exporter, Prometheus exporter for RED metrics
- ☑ One-command `docker-compose` stack — all eight services + NATS JetStream + OTel Collector + Grafana Tempo + Grafana; single `Dockerfile` builds every service from the monorepo; `docker-compose up` starts the full demo; gateway exposed at `localhost:3000`, Grafana at `localhost:3001`

### M1 — Happy-path saga ◐

- ◐ gRPC contracts for the synchronous commands — `coordinator.proto` (`Book`),
  `inventory.proto` (`Hold`/`Release`), `payments.proto`
  (`Authorize`/`Capture`/`Void`), `supplier.proto` (`Confirm`/`Cancel`), and
  `ledger.proto` (`Commit`/`Reverse`) defined and served; the notifier contract
  upcoming
- ◐ `gateway` is the booking's entry point — `POST /bookings` opens the root span
  and calls `Coordinator.Book` over gRPC, returns the recorded outcome, and
  `GET /bookings/:id` reads a booking's fate back; this is how a booking is
  started from outside the system
- ◐ Coordinator drives `hold → authorize → confirm → capture → commit` over gRPC
  (verified end to end against the four live leg services); the async `notify`
  step runs in the `notifier` service, which now **subscribes to `ledger.committed`
  off the configured broker** (`BrokerSubscriptionHost`) and notifies the customer
  — so the saga's tail is wired end to end over the broker, in-process under the
  in-memory default and cross-service under `BROKER=nats`
- ◐ Per-service state — inventory owns holds and per-SKU availability; payments
  owns authorizations and captures, wrapping a simulated PSP; supplier owns
  partner confirmations, wrapping a simulated external partner; ledger owns the
  financial record (commit/reverse, no external boundary) (in-memory reference
  stores; the Postgres-backed stores land with the datastore milestone)

### M2 — Outbox ◐

- ◐ Transactional outbox table + relay per service — reusable `libs/outbox`
  (record staging, store contract, trace-aware relay) is built and unit-tested;
  the inventory service stages `inventory.held`/`inventory.released`, the
  payments service stages `payment.authorized`/`.captured`/`.voided`, the
  supplier service stages `supplier.confirmed`/`.cancelled`, and the ledger
  service stages `ledger.committed`/`.reversed` events through an `OutboxStore`
  alongside their state changes. The relay's `Publisher` now has a concrete
  implementation: `@signalman/broker`'s `BrokerPublisher` over the
  `MessageBroker` boundary (with an `InMemoryBroker` reference), so the relay
  publishes onto an actual broker in-process. **Per-service relay wiring is now
  done**: each producing leg registers an `OutboxRelayHost` (broker chosen via
  `createBrokerFromEnv`) that drains its outbox onto the broker on application
  bootstrap and tears down on shutdown — so staged events actually publish in a
  running service, not just in lib tests. The **first consuming-side subscription
  is now wired too**: the notifier registers a `BrokerSubscriptionHost` that
  subscribes its idempotent consumer to `ledger.committed`. The Postgres-backed
  `OutboxStore` and the reconciler's broker-backed source gateway land next
- ☑ Transactional staging (the "transactional" in transactional outbox) —
  `runInTransaction` threads a `UnitOfWork` through a service's business-state
  write and the outbox `add` it accompanies so the two **commit together or not
  at all**, closing the dual-write window in the in-memory reference (not just
  "in Postgres later"). `InMemoryOutboxStore.add(record, tx?)` and every leg
  repository's write now take that unit of work, and **all four legs adopt the
  shape**: ledger (`commit`/`reverse`), inventory (`hold`/`release` — its
  oversell guard stays eager so a would-oversell write rolls the unit of work
  back before anything commits), payments (`authorize`/`capture`/`void`, with the
  PSP call kept outside the transaction as the one side effect that cannot roll
  back), and supplier (`confirm`/`cancel`, with the partner call kept outside
  likewise). Each leg's service test pins the atomicity directly: when the outbox
  `add` throws, the state change rolls back with it — no state without its event.
  The Postgres-backed stores swap in behind the same tokens and get the same
  guarantee from a real database transaction
- ☑ Crash test: no lost and no phantom events — `libs/outbox/durability.spec.ts`
  pins the guarantee against precise crash points: a staging transaction that
  rolls back leaves **no outbox row** (no phantom event ever publishes); a
  committed row is still published when the relay **crashes mid-publish** (its
  lease expires and a restarted relay re-claims it — no lost event); and a crash
  **between the broker accepting the event and the relay recording it**
  re-delivers rather than drops it (at-least-once, the duplicate the idempotent
  inbox absorbs — proven in `@signalman/broker`)

### M3 — Trace propagation ◐

- ◐ One booking = one connected trace across gRPC, async events, external hop —
  **both the synchronous gRPC half and the async-event hop are now wired**. The
  trace now starts at its true origin: the gateway's `POST /bookings` SERVER span
  is the **root**, and the gateway's coordinator client opens a CLIENT span and
  injects the W3C `traceparent` into the gRPC metadata, so the coordinator's
  SERVER span continues from the gateway (the gateway → coordinator hop). From
  there the coordinator's leg clients open a CLIENT span per RPC and inject the
  same `traceparent` (`callWithTrace` / `injectTraceMetadata` in
  `services/coordinator/src/grpc`, mirrored in `services/gateway/src/bookings`),
  and `@signalman/interceptor` extracts that context on the SERVER side
  (`resolveParentContext`) so each leg handler span **continues** the booking
  trace. On the async side, `@signalman/broker` closes the loop: the outbox
  relay publishes each row through `BrokerPublisher` onto the `MessageBroker`
  under a PRODUCER span continuing the staged trace, a subscriber bridges each
  delivery to the inbox `IdempotentConsumer` (`toConsumedMessage`), and its
  CONSUMER span continues that trace. An end-to-end integration test
  (`libs/broker/src/trace-continuity.spec.ts`) asserts the saga step → publish
  (PRODUCER) → consume (CONSUMER) spans share one `traceId` with the right
  lineage (publish parented to the step, consume parented to publish) — the
  async half of the headline. This is now also proven over the **real NATS
  JetStream transport** (`nats-broker.integration.spec.ts`), not just the
  in-memory reference: with `NatsBroker` in the middle the same three spans still
  form one connected trace. The external supplier/PSP CLIENT hops are already
  span-shaped within their legs
- ◐ Span links for fan-out (one event, many consumers) — the broker delivers
  fan-out (every matching subscription gets a copy; queue groups load-balance),
  so the substrate exists; emitting `span links` on the fan-out consume spans
  is still to do
- ◐ Spans align to OTel RPC + messaging semantic conventions — both sides of the
  gRPC hop now carry `rpc.system`/`rpc.service`/`rpc.method` (CLIENT and SERVER);
  the messaging-semconv check lands with the broker

### M4 — Compensations ◐

- ◐ Failure paths unwind in reverse — the coordinator saga runs the completed
  steps' compensations in reverse (`supplier.cancel → payments.void →
  inventory.release`) on any rejection or outage, best-effort over the idempotent
  leg compensations; unit-tested for every failure position and verified end to
  end. The compensation gRPC calls now carry the booking trace too (M3); the
  forced-mid-saga demo across the fully wired stack lands with the broker
- ◐ Compensations visible as spans — each compensation runs in its own
  compensation-flagged span under the `Book` SERVER span, and with M3's gRPC
  propagation the legs' own SERVER spans now fold into the same cross-service
  trace

### M5 — Idempotency ◐

- ◐ Inbox dedup; redelivery-safe consumers — reusable `libs/inbox`
  (`processOnce` dedup contract, in-memory reference store, trace-aware
  `IdempotentConsumer`) is built and unit-tested, and has its first real consumer:
  the `notifier` wires an `IdempotentConsumer` (namespace `notifier`) around its
  `ledger.committed` handler, redelivery-safe and trace-continuing. The dedup is
  now exercised over the **actual broker boundary** — the `libs/broker`
  integration test drives a duplicate delivery (→ processed once, second tagged a
  duplicate) and a NACK (handler throws → broker redelivers → reprocessed) through
  the consumer, proving effectively-once over at-least-once delivery rather than
  in isolation. The notifier now **runs this over the broker in the service
  itself**: a `BrokerSubscriptionHost` subscribes the consumer to
  `ledger.committed`, and a module-level wiring test drives a redelivered event
  through the registered host onto a shared broker and asserts the customer is told
  exactly once. The Postgres-backed `InboxStore` and the reconciler's subscription
  land with the datastore and the reconciler's source gateway

### M6 — Reconciler ◐

- ☑ Periodic comparison of sources of truth (supplier vs ledger vs inventory) —
  the `reconciler` service runs `ReconcilerService.runOnce` on a scheduler, and
  the pure `detectDivergences` engine compares each settled booking's
  inventory/supplier/ledger states against the consistency invariants. The
  comparison, the scheduler, the findings store, and the trace linkage are built
  and unit-tested. The **broker-backed `SourceOfTruthGateway`** (`BrokerSourceOfTruthGateway`)
  is now wired: it subscribes to `inventory.*`, `supplier.*`, and `ledger.*` on the
  configured broker (via `BrokerSubscriptionHost`), projects per-booking state from
  arriving events, and applies a configurable settle-grace window
  (`RECONCILER_SETTLE_GRACE_MS`, default 10 s) so only idle (not mid-saga) bookings
  are reconciled. The reconciler module now uses this broker-backed gateway in
  production, and a module-level wiring test drives real broker events through the
  subscription host and into the reconciler, proving both that the gateway projection
  works and that a deliberately induced divergence (supplier confirmed, ledger absent)
  produces a `supplier_confirmed_ledger_missing` finding
- ☑ Divergence findings linked to the originating booking trace — each new
  `DivergenceFinding` opens a `reconcile.divergence` span carrying a span link to
  the booking's trace context (lifted from the snapshot) and stamps the finding's
  `traceId`, so a finding is navigable straight back to the trace that explains
  it, even though the reconciler runs out-of-band on its own trace

### M7 — Metrics + logs ◐

- ◐ RED metrics and per-step SLOs in Grafana (RED instrumentation lives in `libs/interceptor`; Grafana dashboards/SLOs still to wire)
- ☑ Trace-correlated structured logging (`trace_id`/`span_id`) — `libs/logging`

### M8 — Harden + ship ☐

- ◐ External-boundary latency/failure injection — the payments `SimulatedPsp`
  injects controllable latency and decline/failure on the PSP hop, and the
  supplier `SimulatedSupplierPartner` applies the same pattern to the partner
  boundary (deliberately slower and flakier defaults), each an errored CLIENT
  span when it fails; the per-step SLOs and chaos wiring land later
